# RandomRouteGenerator
A Geographic Information System (GIS) - a map software that was developed in C++ along with a team of two others. This software employs the OpenStreetMap database and offers a wide array of features. Among its capabilities are determining the shortest route between two points, providing step-by-step directions for the entire journey, and more. These functionalities were made possible by developing custom algorithms inspired by the Dijkstra and A* algorithms.   

True to its name, its primary purpose is to generate random routes based on a specified starting point and desired travel distance. This application is a fully operational software complete with a functional Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is built using the EZGL and GTK libraries.

## Disclaimer
This repository explains the functionalities of this GIS software that I developed during a Software Design and Communication course in my second year of Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. The README file also includes screenshots and GIFs that illustrate the functionalities of the map. As this project is part of an academic course at the University of Toronto, I cannot publicly share the actual code for the GIS software to prevent students from committing Academic Integrity violations by copying it.   

Employers are encouraged to ask me for the Code if they are considering hiring me.   

## Motivation
We chose the idea of "Random Routes" for our GIS project to make things more interesting during activities like exercise, walks, and runs. It's also perfect for breaking the routine of taking the same old routes to work or school every day. Imagine if you could mix things up and add a bit of excitement to your daily travels! This is all about enjoying the outdoors, staying active, and saying goodbye to the boredom of sticking to the same paths. It's designed for folks who love staying fit and exploring the city.
